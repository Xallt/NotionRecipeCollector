# Notion Recipe Collector

Project intented to eventually deploy a fancy home menu to a website.

For now it's just a Notion API script

## Setup

Shouldn't need any &mdash; just a Python 3.8+ interpreter and the `requests` library

## Usage

```bash
NOTION_API_KEY=<your key> python print_recipes.py
```
